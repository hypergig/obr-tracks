## Manifest URL

https://obr-tracks.web.app/manifest.json

## Quick Start

1. Upload an audio track to Google Drive
2. Share it to anyone with the link
3. Copy the link
4. Go to Tracks
5. Click the menu button
6. Add Track
7. Fill in your Title
8. Paste the URL you copied from Google Drive
9. Add some tags so you can quickly find it later
10. Save

It doesn't have to be Google Drive, as long as the track is publicly available without needing to login to access it, it should work great.

## What does it do?

Tracks allows you to play publicly hosted audio files in a Room. The audio is synchronized across all Players, so everyone hears the same thing at the same time. The music continues to loop automatically which makes it perfect for long running audio tracks filled with ambiance and light music. Tracks is not awesome with quick short bites like sound effects.

Tracks is optimized for quickly finding and playing audio tracks while in session. It was designed to handle huge libraries, with a powerful search to help you locate what you're looking for without getting distracted by too many controls or features.
